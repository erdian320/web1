    		<h2>Introduction to Flamingos</h2>
    		   <p>
    		   Flamingos are one of the most interesting types of animals in the world. There are six known species of them out there. They are different from many other types of birds because of the length of their legs. They aren’t often seen flying but they certainly can just like other birds. It was long debated though if they should be classified as storks or ducks. Finally, it was decided that they should have their own classification.
    		   </p>
    		       <br>
               <p>
               The coloring for a Flamingo ranges from various shapes of pink all the way to a crimson red. Some of them are shades of orange too. They also have colors of cream and white mixed in. They are lovely creatures and they seem to be very calm. If you have a local zoo then chances are you have been able to see and to observe these animals up close.
    		   </p>
    		       <br>
    		   <p>
    		   Flamingos live in a variety of habitat locations. They are fine in both warm and cold areas. They live in both the mountain areas and the flat lands. However, they do need plenty of access to food and to water. They are found in lakes, lagoons, and even swamps all over. As long as there are small insects, crustaceans, and algae they seem to have the food sources that they need.
    		   </p>
    		       <br>
    		   <p>
    		   These animals are very social and they thrive on interaction with each other. Colonies of Flamingos in the wild can be thousands in number. Many of them are small though with only about 50 in them. The largest group of Flamingos is found in East Africa where a single colony has more than 1 million members. They engage in a variety of behaviors that are fascinating to watch.
    		   </p>
    		       <br>
    		   <p>
    		   During mating, the Flamingos will pair up and they stay with each other after mating to create the nest for the egg. Then also work as a team to keep the egg warm and safe for about 30 days until it hatches. Young Flamingos are fed crop milk that the parents both produce instead of regurgitated foods as other birds provide for their young.
    		   </p>
    		       <br>
    		   <p>
    		   Many people don’t realize how much Flamingos fly or their abilities. They can take off rapidly and fly up to 35 miles per hour. They can also fly hundreds of miles a day between different locations in order to find adequate amounts of food for them to survive on. Most of this flight time takes place at night though which is why many of us never see them.
    		   </p>
               <p>
               Flamingos tend to live a long life in the wild though with an average of 25 to 30 years. In captivity some of them have lived up to 40 years. They aren’t really in danger of extinction at this time but some conservation efforts are in place. This is based on research that shows introduction of bacteria into the water has killed of large numbers of them in certain areas.

		  <h2>Conversation</h2>
		  <h3>Flamingo and Global warming</h3>
		  <p>Global warming is an issue that has been harming our environment for a very long time. Most of us don’t see the long term effects of it though which can make it hard to really decide to make positive changes. The Flamingos are affected in many ways due to global warming. Here are some of the problems they face as a result of it.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>One of the biggest concerns out there with Flamingos and global warming is how it affects their mating season. The Flamingos depend  on the rainfall to help them mate. Without adequate rain though they won’t engage in it. Many researchers find that global warming reduces the chances of rain in many areas. In fact, it is the leading cause of drought in some of the areas where they live. This can mean a significant reduction of offspring being produced in the years ahead.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Global warming can also dry out the lagoons, lakes, and swampy areas where Flamingos live. This can affect the amount of alkaline that is in the water. When it becomes to acid like they won’t be able to survive in it. They also won’t have a habit to live in or to find food in.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Without that water they will either need to find a new habitat, be relocated, or they will die. They can’t survive without adequate fresh water to drink. They also rely upon the waters to provide them with sources of food. Their bright colors come from the Beta Carotene found in the foods they eat. When they don’t get enough food, they will start to fade in color to very light shades of pink and even white.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>By the same token, global warming is opening up the risk of new diseases and bacteria killing them in large numbers. The heat can allow such elements to quickly grow and to spread. It also allows these types of toxins to be more potent so what used to not bother them such as various types of blue and green algae can become lethal for them to consume.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Predators seem to be seeking out more Flamingos than in the past due to global warming. Their own habitats and food sources have started to decline so they are turning to new places to live and new foods that will satisfy them. These animals include pythons, large cats, coyotes, and more. They have always been predators of the Flamingo but not to the same volume that it seems to be happening in today’s society.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Since we already know that global warming is a huge problem for animals including the Flamingo and humans, sincere efforts to change it have to be made. Many advocacy groups dedicate large amounts of time and money to getting the message across. At the same time celebrities engage in fundraising efforts and to increase awareness of the problem. Still, it comes down to individuals making a conscious choice to do better and to find ways they can help reduce the problem.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>At the same time it is the responsibility of governments to create laws to make the environment safer for all of us. Without their intervention and many great incentives to reduce problems, global warming efforts wouldn’t have made the many advancements that they have so far. New technology offers great ways for us to still get the results and benefits that give us many comforts in life. Yet at the same time they won’t be as harmful for the environment. Exploring those options is a step in the right direction for each of us to take.</p>
